## Project Description  
This project is a simple Python console application that generates a student ID profile.  
The program asks the user for personal and academic information such as name, age, department, level, and student ID number.  
It performs basic calculations, including BMI, age in five years, and the expected graduation year.  
The goal of this project is to practise variables, data types, input(), casting, arithmetic expressions, and formatted output using Python.  
The program finishes with a clean and well-organized summary screen showing the student's complete profile
